# BigRed(dit)

<h1>Overview</h1>
The idea behind BigRed is to provide a programatic interface for Reddit users to have their actions augmented. 
Right now BigRed doesn't do very much. In fact, all he does is follow around /u/TheSpellingAsshole and ask him to be less rude, in addition to giving him the occasional downvote. 


<h1>Setup</h1>


<h1>Potential Features:</h1>
	<li>Get emails of pms to BigRed</li>
	<li>Set up BigRed with multiple user accounts</li>
	<li>Notify user when a topic in their expertise is mentioned</li>
	<li></li>


Known issues with BigRed(dit):
	1. Potential to continuously throw errors if user is logged out.
	2. Issue with deleted comments--not quite sure what the issue is. 

Proposed improvements (in no order):
	1. Needs implementation of OAuth in order to have login info persist beyond August 3. 
	2. Needs build out of error handling. 
	3. Needs a better interface for operating multiple accounts
	4. Needs build out of reply mechanism (perhaps something just a little less basic.)
	5. Needs build out of targets. 
	6. More dynamic voting/comments threshholds.
	7. Automatic folder creation for error output dumps/handling errors better ;)
